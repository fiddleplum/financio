Multiple vs Single Root

If you have a component with a single element as its root, and then you have another component that just has the first component as its root, not all of the second component's root nodes will have the proper classes to identify them as the components. So you could have three nested components, but it'll look like this:

<div class="Component1">
	<div class="Component3"></div>
</div>

And so Component2 isn't represented because it only contained a single Component3 root node.

So every component should have a single root node (not zero or multiple) for it to be instantiated properly.




SVG needs to be imported in JS or in www/svg.
HTML needs to reference imported SVG or href to www/svg.
Does CSS need anything that could require it to be in JS?

If HTML is imported as .html file:
* It looks a little odd when it references JS vars and functions via on events or html vars.
* SVG must be referenced via <img src...
* SVG must then be in the www/svg folder.

If HTML is in JS:
* SVG can be in JS.
  * Multiple components may need the same SVG, so this doesn't work.
* SVG must be imported or referenced as <img src...
	* If SVG is imported as .svg file, but HTML is in JS, this feels incongruous.
	* If SVG is referenced as <img src..., it must be in the www/svg folder.

Options:
* HTML imported, SVG as <img src... in www/svg.
* HTML inline,
		* SVG as <img src... in www/svg.
		* SVG imported.

Decisions:
(1)
HTML and CSS will be inline. This will allow for maximum flexibility.
SVG will be imported, so that they can be properly edited.

OR

(2)
HTML and CSS will be imported
SVG will be as <img src... in www/svg.

BUT BUT BUT SVG images aren't affected by css, only inline are!

This means that the SVG *must* be inline and therefore imported.
The only option that supports importing SVGs is when the HTML is imported.

So:
SVG must be imported.
HTML must be inline in the JS so that it can reference the imported SVG variable.
Put all .svg files in a single src/svg folder, since they aren't unique to each component.
Make CSS inline as well, since the HTML already is, for consistency.
