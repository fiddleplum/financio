# Types of Accounts

Checking
Savings
Credit Card
Asset that has market value (house, car, etc).
Mortgage Debt
Loan of any kind
Stock or shares in something that has market value per share.

Each account has transactions except assets with market value.
Some accounts have value other than $, like shares.
Some accounts have automatic transactions, like loans that charge interest monthly.
Some accounts have a total value that goes up and down, either manually or based on an external source.

Account properties:
hasTransactions (everything but single assets, this can just be true and there are no transactions in the single assets)
currency (stocks have shares, house/car have currency of items, and you can update the price per item)

# Add opposite transaction to other account.

When categorizing a transaction, make an option to add an opposite amount in another account. For instance, when my checking account transfers out $ to my mortgage, my mortgage account doesn't have automatic transactions (possibly), so I may need to manually add a transaction of the opposite amount. Or, I could have the nice button that does it for me.

# Other types of value.

If I have a stock account, I have a certain amount of shares. So the transactions from one account to another, if they have different units, should ask for the exchange rate, which in the case of stocks, would be the stock price per share.

# Funds

If I want to have a spending fund, where the bank account puts money into it every month, but there's no actual money transfered between physical accounts, how do I do that?

It can't be an actual transaction from a checking account to the fund, since that would subtract money out from the checking account.

Perhaps it has to be a sub account of checking, but then it would we couldn't put anything from the savings account into the savings fund, since it would be limited to the checking account.

Perhaps I can have virtual accounts and the money in any physical account can be marked as being in a virtual account as a special kind of transaction. It's actually like categories but for assets instead of flow!

Transactions can have categories.
Assets/Accounts can have funds.
